# Mastermind in Z80

This project is an implementation of the **Mastermind** game in assembly language for the **Z80** processor. It was created for the course **Computer Architecture and Organization**.

## Description

Mastermind is a logic game in which a player must guess a secret combination of colors generated by the computer within a limited number of attempts. 

This project was developed to better understand computer architecture concepts, assembly programming, and direct hardware interaction through the Z80 processor.

## Features

- Full implementation of the Mastermind game.
- Visual feedback of the player's attempts (correct and incorrect).
- Limited number of attempts to guess the combination.

## Requirements

This project was developed to run in an environment compatible with the Z80 architecture. To test or run the code in a Z80 emulator, ensure you have a suitable setup, such as:

- **Z80 Emulator** (e.g., Z80 Emulator).
- **Z80 Assembler** (e.g., TASM or similar).
